Overfitting may arise because of adding too many independent variables and model capturing random noise of our sample rather than reflecting the general trend. Our model should not only fit the current sample, but new samples as well. To find out if our model is overfit, we will have to do train-test split and find out if our model is able to capture a genaral trend from training set and whether it can predict on test set. \n",
    "1. If we take a look at the p-values of the coefficients, only few p-vales are statistically significant and if we delete few non-significant variables from the equation, the R square values actually drops along with adjusted R sqaure. This could be becaus of multicollinearity among the variables. Not all the cariables are needed to build a model however it is not only hard to determine which variables are worth keeping but also time consuming if we keep testing each variable. Multicollinearity affects the coeffiecients and p-values but does not influence the predictions, precision of predictions and the goodness of fit statistics. Since our primary goal here is to fit the model for better predictions and not understand the role of each independent variable, we can use regularization to give importance to important parameters thus reducing the complexity of the model if needed.
